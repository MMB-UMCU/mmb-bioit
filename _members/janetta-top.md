Iâ€™m assistant professor in the group of Rob Willems at the Medical Microbiology Department at the UMCU.

I am coordinating the microbiome facility, which includes the contact with medical departments within the UMCU that collect samples from chorts of patients, supervision of technicians in the lab who perform the wet-lab part, including DNA extractions and sequencing and I also perform the downstream analysis of the data. We mainly perform 16S rRNA analysis and metagenomics shotgun sequencing. For the analysis, I make use of the bioinformatic pipelines developed within the BioIT group and R-scripts.
